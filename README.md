## CELESTRIAL BODIES DATABASE IN POSTGRES SQL
----
I started a bootcamp by KANZUCODE and CODEIMPACT a month ago and it came to my realization that in the near future we would use postgress as a database of choice.

I was a bit worried since I always liked working with mongodb. But I decided to just find a resource that would help me instead of doing nothing about my worries.
I landed on a FREECODECAMP course that teaches relational database though still in a Beta version. I started working out some projects.
Celestrial bodies project is one of the Capstone projects in this course.

#### Project

At first I was confused on how to go about this project because I lacked interest in dealing with Celestrial. I got to the internet started reading some sources about these objects. But it was literally hard to gather data together. Thats when I landed on a medium article of [Sri Hatini](https://medium.com/@sri.hartini?source=---three_column_layout_sidebar----------------------------------).

This was an article about how she gathered data of the same project, Woow!!!!
That was my lucky day since this python queen saved me alot of time on this project. I got a shared of the data she collected from her GitHub account and Here I am.
It was a bit challengit but here I am.
